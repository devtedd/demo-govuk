# GOV.UK node application starter

The idea of this application is to provide a good base application that I can use for building further applications on top of.

Providing only the very basics.

This relies on the govuk packages at : https://github.com/alphagov/govuk_frontend_toolkit and https://github.com/alphagov/govuk_template_mustache and https://github.com/alphagov/govuk_elements


Originally had `"govuk-elements": "git+https://github.com/alphagov/govuk_elements.git#v.1.0.0",` to install elements from git, but the project is now held on npm for sass.
