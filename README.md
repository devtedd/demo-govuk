# GOV.UK node application starter

The idea of this application is to provide a good base application that I can use for building further applications on top of.

Providing only the very basics.

This relies on the govuk packages at : https://github.com/alphagov/govuk_frontend_toolkit and https://github.com/alphagov/govuk_template_mustache

Added https://github.com/alphagov/govuk_elements as a dependency from where the css is obtained, however from pull request https://github.com/alphagov/govuk_elements/pull/156 it looks like an npm depency will be created soon.

Templating provided by handlebars

Server logs provided by good

Currently installed on heroku at https://still-shelf-6288.herokuapp.com/

For the time being bootstrap has been used for dummy content.

### Other stuff to add:
1. Authentication
2. Database
