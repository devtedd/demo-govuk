# GOV.UK node application starter

The idea of this application is to provide a good base application that I can use for building further applications on top of.

Providing only the very basics.

This relies on the govuk packages at : [https://github.com/alphagov/govuk_frontend_toolkit] and [https://github.com/alphagov/govuk_template_mustache]

It also relies on the sass in the project [https://github.com/alphagov/govuk_elements] but this is not available as an npm dependency at the moment so this has to be manually pulled down and the sass files copied accross to the project when required.

Templating provided by handlebars

Server logs provided by good

Currently installed on heroku at https://calm-savannah-7428.herokuapp.com/

For the time being bootstrap has been used for dummy content.

### Other stuff to add:
1. Authentication
2. Database
